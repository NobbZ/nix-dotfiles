= Dotfiles
:toc: macro

This is just another approach to organize my dotfiles in a repository.

toc::[]

== Sources

There are some old repositories I used to configure stuff.
My actual dotfiles have been private for a long time as they contain secrets.
I will probably never open them.

Though I configured other programs by other means, as I (re) discover those sources I will add them to the list:

.Sources for this new dotfile repo
* https://gitlab.com/NobbZ/emacs.d[emacs config]
